Visualization 2: 'Frequency of "Daisy" as a baby girl name in Ontario over the years'

> What software did you use to create your data visualization?  
    - Excel

> Who is your intended audience?  
    - Potential parents or individuals who are interested in the first name 'Daisy' for female babies and its popularity over the survey period (1913-2023) in Ontario.

> What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization?  
    - The visualization shows the frequency in time series of the first name 'Daisy' registered for baby girls in Ontario during a period of 110 years between 1913 and 2023 which in this case displays an overall increase trend.

> What aspects of design did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply them? With what elements of your plots?  
    - The graph focused on 1 clear specific message "The trend of the name 'Daisy' over the years", giving audience a clear view of its general trend without being cluttered with extra information.\
    - By plotting the data over time using a line plot, the visualization shows the changes in frequency across years. Markers are used to highlight each data point.\
    - Since the graph focuses on change over time, the graph is adjusted to have a wider horizontal dimension in the x-axis direction compared to the vertical dimension in the y-axis direction.\
    - The markers are chosen to be clearly distinguishable from the dashed style line to ensure readability.
    
> How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization?  
    - A template used for data and chart should be saved and followed when the value of name is changed to produce the same type and format of visualization.\
    - Data integriy and organization needs to be checked to ensure every row is a single observation and every column a single variable, with no empty cells or merged cells.\
    - If the tool used to make the data visualization was not reproducible, this would limit access and flexibility, making it difficult for others to replicate the original work or tweak the visualization in any way for their own purposes.

> How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    - Color contrast: I use blue dashed-style trend lines and red markers to ensure markers and trend are clearly distinguishable and readable.\
    - Font: The axis labels, title, and data labels are chosen with readable font size.

> Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    - Expecting parents in Ontario who are considering to name their female baby 'Daisy' might want to know how popular the name has been over the years.\
    - People with first name 'Daisy' might want to see how popular it was in the year they were born and how it has changed over time.

> How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization?  
    - I want to show the frequency of the specific first name 'Daisy' registered for baby girl over the years in Ontario during entire time range of the dataset (1913 to 2023) so all other names are excluded to not overwhelm the viewers. 

> What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?  
    - Hospital staff who recorded the data over the years.\
    - All personnel who participate in the process of data collection, compilation, processing, and making this dataset publibly available for use.
