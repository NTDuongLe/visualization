# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Good Visualization: 
      > Name: GLOBAL LAND-OCEAN TEMPERATURE INDEX
      > Source: https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/?intent=121
      > Comments:
        >> 1. The chart communicates clearly a single message "global temperatures have risen significantly since the late 19th century" without being cluttered with extra information.
        >> 2. Data presentation is aesthetic and clear: The chart uses neutral color scheme. The axes are labeled clearly with logical orders, units, and scales which effectively provide an explanation of the data. The font size and legends are well proportionated and positioned for clear viewing. 
        >> 3. Data coverage is sufficient for its purpose: Spanning from 1880 to the present, the chart demonstrates both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends, providing historical context. Since climate change is a compliated and extended process, presenting insufficient data, for example only a few years, will make the conclusion less credible and reliable. 
        
       Bad Visualization: 
      > Name: MLB percentage rise in viewership compared to 2024
      > Source: https://www.instagram.com/p/DKk3XEDzGLy/
      > Comments:
        >> 1. Incorrect chart type: The green line graph connects the tops of bars, implying a progression of the x-axis data but the x-axis show different networks, not a time series. This falsely suggests causality or a trend between networks.Line graphs should be used for continuous data (like changes over time). 
        >> 2. Lack of Context or Raw Data: No baseline viewership numbers are shown (e.g., 13% increase of how many viewers?).Percentages can mislead without raw values or total reach data.
        >> 3. Lack of Data Source & Date Range Specificity: ‚ÄúCompared to 2024‚Äù is vague as we don't know which period of comparison is used (full year is compared or playoff vs regular season). Without clarity, viewers can‚Äôt verify or interpret the data properly.














      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
     Bad Visualization: 
     1. Remove the green line graph as the data shown on the x-axis (network stations) and y-axis (viewership percentage increase) are independent in terms of trend. Switching the position of the network stations on the x-axis will give a totally different line shape. 
     2. Add Baseline Viewership Numbers: Percentages are incomplete without context ‚Äî a 27% increase on a small number may still mean fewer total viewers than a 10% increase on a large number.
     3. Clarify the Time Frame of Comparison: Add a subtitle or footnote - for example: ‚ÄúPercentage change in average regular season viewership, April‚ÄìJune 2024 vs. April‚ÄìJune 2023‚Äù. The user of the visualization need to know what period is being compared.




      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
